3hour shooter but godot

# Developement Plan
The current plan is to clone my previous game, 3hour shooter but in godot. This will be my first project in godot. A couple of twists are planned however.

The following features are nessesary:
1) movement
2) shooting
3) enemies that chace the player
4) which die when shot
5) that reduce the player's hp when they run into them
6) enemies infinitely spawn

The plan is to have this completed within 6 hours of developement time.
